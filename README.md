# ðŸŽ® Unified Distributional Dueling Noisy DQN

This repository contains the implementation of a unified Deep Q-Network (DQN) architecture that integrates three powerful reinforcement learning strategies:
- **Dueling DQN**
- **Distributional DQN (C51)**
- **Noisy Networks**

The combined architecture addresses common deep RL challenges like unstable training, poor exploration, and overestimation bias â€” leading to improved learning robustness and efficiency.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project investigates whether integrating these three complementary techniques can enhance the performance of deep reinforcement learning agents. The model is trained and evaluated on the **CartPole-v1** environment using **TensorFlow** and **Gym**, achieving:
